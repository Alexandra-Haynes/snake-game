### This small project helped recap:
- grid layout;
- vmin for borders;
- working with module type JS files;
- using window.requestAnimationFrame;
- keydown event listener and swtich(e.key);
- creating randomized position for elements;
- restarting game with window.location('/');
- working with x and y axes and arrays of objects for moving elements;

### Future improvements to be added (once I learn how to do it ðŸ˜†): 
- adding score and high score;
- offering the possibility to select a speed level to increase difficulty;
- adding a Start game and a Game Over screen;
- customizing the snake skin, expecially the head segment;
- design improvements;
- adding audio;
- providing different types of food;
- chess-like board pattern;
